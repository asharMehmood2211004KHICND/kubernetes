deployments enable us to rollout to the specific version of image

rolling update -> zero down time    ----- why scaling up and down here.

recreate --> delete all pods , then recreate --> there will be a downtime

e.g mysql --> recreate

when we update a deployment a new rs is created and old one got down
--------------------------------

when we want alot of changes in our deployment we pause and resume it.

pausing a deployment doesnt mean the traffic will not be able to access our deployed app.
it means everything that we do now is paused (e.g changing version etc)
